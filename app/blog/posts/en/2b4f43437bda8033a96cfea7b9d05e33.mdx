I, Yeojindol, have finally created my personal blog.

My acquaintances and I had planned to create a blog, but due to lack of time, it kept getting postponed. I've finally gotten around to it. (To be honest, I had somewhat forgotten about it...)

I've written about the process in a very light, diary-like fashion.

## Getting Started

I was at a loss as to where to begin, but Chan-gyu shared a [template](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/solutions/blog) with me.

Basic elements like OG tags and sitemaps were well-implemented, so it was mostly a matter of just focusing on the design. Others mentioned they completed their blogs in just a few hours using this template with 'vibe coding,' so I started with a light heart.

## Design

I've always liked the iPod Classic.

So, I spent a lot of time creating a design guide `md` file with Claude.

I created the design guide file through extensive discussions, referencing iPod photos on Google and discussing curved gradients, among other things.

While not entirely satisfied, it turned out quite well, achieving the desired feel...

## CMS

When discussing how to create the blog with my acquaintances, this workflow emerged from our deliberations on how to manage blog posts.

It's a workflow where posts are easily written in Notion and then `md` files are uploaded to GitHub.

### Image Handling

A point to note is that Notion images have an expiration time, so images must either be saved locally or uploaded separately to S3 for use.

Saving images locally can increase the bundle size, so I opted to use S3.

### Multilingual Support

I aimed to translate Notion posts using the Gemini API and provide an English version alongside the original.

I asked for the API prompt to be created with 'vibe coding.' I'm satisfied with it.

```typescript
function createTranslationPrompt(content: string): string {
  return `You are a professional technical translator specializing in software engineering content.

Task: Translate the following Korean blog post to natural, fluent English.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Preserve ALL Markdown syntax EXACTLY (##, ###, -, *, \`, \`\`\`, >, [], (), etc.)
2. DO NOT translate:
   - Code blocks (content inside \`\`\` \`\`\`)
   - Code snippets (content inside \` \`)
   - URLs and links
   - File paths and file names
   - Package names and technical identifiers
   - HTML/JSX tags
3. Translate frontmatter fields:
   - title: Translate to natural English
   - summary: Translate to natural English
   - Keep other fields (publishedAt, language, tags) unchanged
   - Change language field value from "ko" to "en"
4. Maintain professional, technical writing style
5. Use standard technical terminology
6. Keep the same structure and formatting

ORIGINAL KOREAN CONTENT:
---
${content}
---

Provide ONLY the translated content in English. Do not add explanations or comments.

TRANSLATED ENGLISH CONTENT:`;
}
```

For other basic content, I handled translation using `intl` libraries.

The user's language is handled so that a default value can be stored and modified in a `cookie`.

## Satisfying Design

This is a design I've wanted to incorporate since I first thought about creating a blog, and it's so cute. I'm satisfied.

## TODO..

1.  Add Redis operations for page views, visits, etc.
2.  Design improvements
